# IS 477 Project Plan

**Overview**

In this project, we aim to examine how public sentiment surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic has shifted over time, with particular attention to the period before and after the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as different vaccine uptake rates. The pandemic, by forcing people into quarantine and limiting in-person interaction, made digital platforms one of the primary channels through which individuals expressed their thoughts, fears, and hopes. As a result, online platforms such as Instagram provide a large dataset for tracking evolving public opinion. By studying public posts and discussions about COVID-19 on these platforms, we hope to uncover how attitudes changed during phases of the pandemic.

  One of our main goals is to measure these sentiment changes alongside global vaccine uptake data. This pairing allows us to better understand the potential relationship between vaccination progress and public perception of COVID-19. For example, we intend to investigate vaccine hesitancy by identifying periods where public sentiment became more negative, and then comparing these shifts to vaccination rates and distribution milestones. At the same time, we hypothesize that moments of medical advancement, such as the initial release and authorization of vaccines, may correlate with more positive public sentiment due to renewed hope and the possibility of ending the pandemic.
  
  Our methodology will involve data analysis of sentiment classification social media data, anchored by best practices in data management and documentation. Specifically, we will conduct a FAIR analysis to ensure our data processes meet research standards. We also place strong emphasis on maintaining data quality, cleaning and validating our datasets before drawing conclusions. We will thoroughly document our workflow, methods, and findings in accordance with the expectations of the IS 477 curriculum, ensuring the project contributes to a better understanding of pandemic-era discourse.
