# IS 477 Project Plan

**Overview**

In this project, we aim to examine how public sentiment surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic has shifted over time, with particular attention to the period before and after the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as different vaccine uptake rates. The pandemic, by forcing people into quarantine and limiting in-person interaction, made digital platforms one of the primary channels through which individuals expressed their thoughts, fears, and hopes. As a result, online platforms such as Instagram provide a large dataset for tracking evolving public opinion. By studying public posts and discussions about COVID-19 on these platforms, we hope to uncover how attitudes changed during phases of the pandemic.

  One of our main goals is to measure these sentiment changes alongside global vaccine uptake data. This pairing allows us to better understand the potential relationship between vaccination progress and public perception of COVID-19. For example, we intend to investigate vaccine hesitancy by identifying periods where public sentiment became more negative, and then comparing these shifts to vaccination rates and distribution milestones. At the same time, we hypothesize that moments of medical advancement, such as the initial release and authorization of vaccines, may correlate with more positive public sentiment due to renewed hope and the possibility of ending the pandemic.
  
  Our methodology will involve data analysis of sentiment classification social media data, anchored by best practices in data management and documentation. Specifically, we will conduct a FAIR analysis to ensure our data processes meet research standards. We also place strong emphasis on maintaining data quality, cleaning and validating our datasets before drawing conclusions. We will thoroughly document our workflow, methods, and findings in accordance with the expectations of the IS 477 curriculum, ensuring the project contributes to a better understanding of pandemic-era discourse.

**Research Question(s)**

Our research focuses on both quantitative vaccination data and qualitative shifts in public sentiment. During the exploratory data analysis stage of our project, we will examine how vaccination rates changed over time and across regions, asking which countries recorded the highest rates, when vaccination activity peaked, and how patterns differed between early adopters and those with slower rollouts. These questions will help us identify regional variation and contextualize public health responses, as well as help us bring a more comprehensive viewpoint to our findings. Alongside this, we will analyze sentiment classification results to understand how public opinion evolved throughout the pandemic. We will ask how many posts express positive or negative sentiment (as these are the two classifications present in our dataset), whether there is a point where one overtakes the other, and if these changes align with key global milestones such as vaccine approval or mass distribution. Finally, by separating posts by language, we will explore how sentiment varies across linguistic groups. Our dataset is made up of posts made in multiple languages from across the globe, so understanding different linguistic patterns may be able to act as a proxy variable in regards to individual country responses. This preliminary analysis will help us answer our two central research questions: how effective was vaccination rollout and uptake in shifting COVID-19 sentiment across social media, and what unique patterns of vaccine hesitancy or support can be observed in English versus non-English discourse?

**Team**

For this project, we have agreed to arrange meeting times throughout the semester to ensure effective communication and progress. During these meetings, we will both engage and collaborate on coding, writing, and data visualization. We will also allocate responsibilities in an equitable manner. For this project plan, Sarah sourced the data and helped integrate it while Megan conducted a preliminary FAIR assessment on the selected data. Each member will also review the other’s work. 

**Datasets**

The two datasets we have picked to utilize for our project are the following: “COVID-19 Vaccinations by Our World in Data” and “Five Years of COVID-19 Discourse on Instagram.” The vaccination dataset explores a worldwide landscape of COVID-19 vaccinations from December 2, 2020 to December 12, 2023. Sourced from Our World in Data, the vaccination dataset offers information on the progress of international vaccination campaigns. The sentiment classification dataset addresses public discourse on the pandemic, covering 500,123 posts in 161 languages between January 2020 and September 2024. The multilingual analysis was performed by classifying each post as positive, negative, or neutral. Utilizing these datasets allows for examining the relationship between vaccination efforts and public sentiment on social media. 

FAIR Assessment

Findability:
The public sentiment dataset includes a DOI (10.5281/zenodo.13896353), ensuring permanent retrievability and citation consistency. The vaccination dataset does not have a DOI but is hosted on a searchable repository with rich metadata and contributor information. Both datasets can be located using repository search tools and relevant keywords.

Accessibility:
	Both datasets are publicly available and downloadable through HTTPS links. From this, the datasets are open access for researchers and practitioners. Furthermore, the hosting platforms of the dataset, Zenodo and Kaggle, guarantee stable data storage. Therefore, the datasets remain accessible after updates or revisions. This consistent availability supports reproducibility and long-term usability. 

Reusability:
	Each dataset provides essential information such as data collection methods and documentation that outline the dataset’s purpose and structure. Both are released under the CC BY 4.0 open license which allows users to freely share and adapt the data with proper attribution. This licensing supports the responsible reuse of data in future studies.

**Timeline** 

Data Collection and Integration (October 15-22, 2025): During this week, we will download, preprocess, and clean both the vaccination dataset and the public sentiment analysis dataset. The datasets will be standardized and merged to ensure compatibility for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (October 23-30, 2025): We will conduct descriptive analyses to examine vaccination trends over time and across regions. Additionally, public sentiment trends in Instagram posts will be summarized as well as an analysis of language-specific patterns.

Visualization and Interpretation (October 31-November 7, 2025): Data visualizations such as time-series plots of vaccination rates and public sentiment trends will be developed. These results will be interpreted in the context of global vaccination milestones and public discourse to provide meaningful insights.

Interim Status Report Preparation (November 8-10, 2025): A two-page interim status report of approximately 1000-1500 words will be drafted. We will summarize our progress and preliminary findings encountered to date.

Final Project Development (November 11-December 5, 2025): We will refine analyses, and finalize visualizations. Our efforts during this week will focus on ensuring the reproducibility and accuracy of all results.

Final Project Submission (December 6-10, 2025): The completed project will be released on GitHub. We will finalize our code, cleaned datasets, visualizations, and documentation. The final project will be submitted prior to December 10, 2025 once we have completed review and quality checks.
