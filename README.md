# IS 477 Final Project 

Link to Box folder with datasets: https://uofi.box.com/s/e7e2673dnqdzk1yvtle374cq8okac1um

This project uses a simple directory structure to keep the repository clean.
The GitHub repository stores only code and documentation, while all input and output datasets are stored in a separate Box folder due to size and privacy requirements.

The filesystem layout is as follows:

is477/

│
├── data/   

│   └── .gitkeep          # Placeholder so the folder appears in GitHub

│

├── .gitignore 

├── Dataset_Integration_Script.ipynb

├── Run_All_Script_IS477_Final_Project_Workbook.ipynb
